## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python and the Plotly library installed.
2. Copy the provided JSON data into the script or load it from a file.
3. Run the script.

## Description

The script parses the provided JSON data to extract the years and corresponding population values for a specified country (in this case, Brazil). It then creates an interactive bar chart using Plotly, which visualizes the population of the country over time.

## Output

The generated bar chart will be saved as an HTML file named `interactive_bar_chart_brazil.html`.

## Customization

You can customize the script to work with different JSON data or modify the chart's appearance by adjusting the Plotly parameters in the script.
